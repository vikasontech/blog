# Introduction

A graceful shutdown means, in case of system termination, stop receiving new requests and also wait before termination for the in-process requests to finish. Spring provides a shutdown hook with every spring application to achieve it.

# Version Details

* Spring Boot: 2.3.4.RELEASE
* Java: 1.8
* Kotlin: 1.3.72

# Dependencies

* spring-boot-starter-web
* spring-boot-starter-actuator (Optional)

# Implementation 

The implementation is simple, just create a controller class with one get endpoint. To show a long process I have used the sleep method, which will delay the response by 30 seconds. 

{{< gist vikasontech a5e54ec339ddc674b0ddb5525c5014cf>}}

Now endpoint `/test` will take the 60s to finish. We can now shutdown the application now. I use the spring actuator shutdown API to kill the application. You can also kill the application by killing the process or stop the server from the IDE.

# Enable Graceful Shutdown 

To enable graceful shutdown you need to configure `server.shutdown` property, as shown in the following example:

Also to configure the timeout period configure the `spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase` property, as shown in the following example:

{{< gist vikasontech 08d48d527a7eee3f0cafe7995b9b5446>}}

See spring reference document [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-graceful-shutdown)

Call the shutdown endpoint and see the output - 

```
$ http POST :8080/actuator/shutdown -b
{
    "message": "Shutting down, bye..."
}

```

Now, wait for the application to gracefully shutdown. I get null pointer exception -

```
java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at org.springframework.boot.actuate.metrics.web.servlet.LongTaskTimingHandlerInterceptor.stopLongTaskTimers(LongTaskTimingHandlerInterceptor.java:123) ~[spring-boot-actuator-2.2.4.RELEASE.jar:2.2.4.RELEASE]
	at org.springframework.boot.actuate.metrics.web.servlet.LongTaskTimingHandlerInterceptor.afterCompletion(LongTaskTimingHandlerInterceptor.java:79) ~[spring-boot-actuator-2.2.4.RELEASE.jar:2.2.4.RELEASE]
	at org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerExecutionChain.triggerAfterCompletion(HandlerExecutionChain.java:179) ```
```

This is because tomcat shutting down while the request is still in progress. You can see about this [issue here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/16407)

So we need to tell the tomcat to wait for a certain time in case any request is still in progress, before shutdown. To do that we need to create a bean for `ServletWebServerFactory` and set the `unloadDelay` time in the context like this -

{{< gist vikasontech 96a941dc6dfeddf08743972695662b97>}}

I set the unload delay time to `2 minutes` here.

Now let's re-try call our test endpoint `/test` endpoint and then kill the process - 

```
$ http POST :8080/actuator/shutdown -b
{
    "message": "Shutting down, bye..."
}

```

# Output

The application is waiting to finish and after waiting for 60 seconds. I got the response like this - 

```
$ http :8080/test  --timeout 120
HTTP/1.1 200
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 22
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Date: Fri, 16 Oct 2020 11:04:19 GMT
Keep-Alive: timeout=60

Thank you for waiting.

$
```

The application logs look like this - 

```
